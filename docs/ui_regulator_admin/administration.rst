Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Administration section, you can check the **Log entries** and the **Script execution logs**.

Log entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click either the **Log Entries** or **View links** to go to the **Select log entry view** screen. On this screen, you can check and filter what activity was performed, when the change occurred, which user made it, and what content type was updated. Use the **Search** field or the **Filter** section to narrow down the list.

By default, the list items are sorted by **Action Time** in descending order, with the most recent entry at the top and the oldest at the bottom. In this default view, there are no up or down arrows on the right side of the columns.

To sort the list items, first, select the column you want to sort and choose the **sorting order** (ascending or descending). To refine the sorting further, you can select additional columns and specify their sorting order.

When more than one column is used for sorting, numbers appear next to the up or down arrows to indicate the **sorting sequence**. In the example below, the list of entries is sorted first by **Action Time** (descending), then by **User** (ascending), and finally by **Content Type** (descending).

To remove a column from sorting, hover your mouse over the number until an up-and-down triangle appears (see screenshot above). A tooltip saying **Remove from sorting** will be displayed. Click the up-and-down triangle, and the selected column will no longer be used for sorting.

Script execution logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **script execution logs** screen shows the logs from your SERIMA server. The screen shows the log entries in a table format with the columns **Timestamp, Action, Object Representation**, and **Additional information**.

Click the header of any column to sort the entries by that column. An upward-facing triangle in the top-right corner of the column indicates that the entries are sorted in descending order, with older entries at the top and newer ones at the bottom.

Clicking the triangle again reverses the sorting order. When you hover the cursor over the triangle, a pop-up labeled **Toggle Sorting** appears. A downward-facing triangle then indicates that the newest entries are at the top, and older entries are below.

You can sort items by multiple columns. The column headers indicate the sort order, showing which column is first, second, or third in the sequence (and whether the sorting is in ascending or descending order).

The **Object Representation** column shows what activity the script performed. In most cases, this involves deletions: typically of inactive users, users who registered but were not assigned to any company, or users who did not confirm their registration.
